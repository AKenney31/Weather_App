# WeatherApp

API used: http://api.openweathermap.org

## Project Description:
This project, created in python, allows the user to type in any US zip code and it then displays the weather for that area.
The GUI is made using tkinter, the data is from the API mentioned above, and the grahpics are made using python's turtle graphics library.
Yes I could've just used images but where is the fun in that?

## How To Run:
This project incoorporates a virtual environment containing the required installations. In the project's main directory (Weather_App) open up a terminal, and 
run the following command: 
        '\venv\Scripts\activate.bat'
After the venv is activated, as long as you have a python configuration with 'weather\main.py' as the main script, the project should run.
